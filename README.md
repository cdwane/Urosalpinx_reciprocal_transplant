# Urosalpinx_reciprocal_transplant

Data and code to support manuscript submission "Adaptation to warm environments with a fast pace of life in a marine predatory snail". 
-----
Scripts folder contains the following R scripts:


# Script 01. Data Setup: 

Converts files in the raw_data folder into processed data used in scripts 02, 03, and 04.

# Script 02. Statistical tests and outputs: 

Contains code to reproduce all statistical tests in the manuscript, as well as random effect model selection comparisons in Appendix S1 Table S2 and ANOVA outputs presented in Appendix S2 Table S1. This script ideally requires Script 01 to be run first to generate the processed data files, but alternatively can be run by manually loading the processed data from the "processed_data" folder using the hashed out code lines for each 

# Script 03. Graphics script:

 This script reproduces figures 2-4 in the manuscript. This Script requires either scripts 01 or 02 to be run first to load the processed data.

# Script 04: Supplementary figure including Georgia:

 This script uses versions of the processed datasheets containing data from the Goergia population, which was not included in the main analysis. It requires Script 01 to be run first to load the necessary processed data.
